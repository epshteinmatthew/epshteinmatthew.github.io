    <h2>It's been one year,</h2>
    <h1>ONE YEAR TOO LONG</h1>
    <p>I am writing this on October 7, 2024. On this day last year, a tragedy occurred. Thousands of militants, the vast majority of them Hamas, broke the border with Israel and began an invasion. Once in Israel, they perpetrated the deadliest massacre in the country's history. 1,200 people, from across the various divides which threaten to tear Israel apart, were murdered. In addition, some 200 people were taken hostage into Gaza. At the moment, 101 of them remain in captivity. </p>
	<p>One year has passed since that dark day. As I write, the grim anniversary is being marked by millions, in Israel and abroad. Over the last year, Israel has been at war, first with Hamas in Gaza, and more recently with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Tens of thousands of Gazans and Lebanese have died as a result. Israeli bombs fall more callously now than they did in other wars -- the calculus has changed. It is understood now in Israel that Hamas and Hezbollah must be pursued and eliminated, lest they be allowed to mount another attack. This truth, however, is cold comfort to those caught in the crossfire. We cannot disregard their suffering -- it is our suffering as well.</p>
<p>Every second we let pass in conflict adds an additional weight to our collective soul. We do not feel the weight at first, and once we start to we decide that it would be too costly, too difficult, to remove. If we wait long enough, we will realize that we no longer have the choice. The weight will sink us -- Israelis and Palestinians -- into our graves. It has already cost us the lives of our brothers and sisters. As I write, it is costing the lives of those held hostage -- every second they remain is a second taken from the lives that they deserve to live.</p>
<p>The generation growing up now will undoubtedly live the rest of their lives in the shadow of October 7th. They will grow up knowing intimately the pain which comes downstream from the conflict. To compare it to being torn apart is to be conservative -- almost to a fault. Words cannot do justice to the pain, and, quite frankly, they never will. But actions might.</p>
<p>I read recently that October 7th, 2023 marks the end of the post-Holocaust era. By "post-holocaust era," the author meant the 80-odd years after the Holocaust during which a self-assurance existed among the Jewish people, both in Israel and in diaspora, backed up by assurances from the world at large that never again meant never again, as well as a determination from the State of Israel to keep the world honest. This assurance no longer exists. It cannot exist when Israel's "low-tech" enemy -- Hamas -- can at once end the conception of a small, smart army, and cause the single deadliest day in Israeli history. It cannot exist when the government functions to divide the people, when security cabinet meetings end in the Defense Minister's pleas for a hostage deal being shouted down. It cannot coexist with, as the Hostage Families Forum calls it, abandonment.</p>
<p>The present situation seems to lead only to despair. Neither Jews in Israel nor in the diaspora are safe, it seems, and the dangers are growing. Israel is now engaged in a war with another enemy, an enemy more powerful than Hamas, an enemy closer to Iran. The war has resulted -- for the first time in Israel's history -- in the indefinite evacuation of Israelis from Israel proper. Make no mistake, the horrors of today are unprecedented, as are the challenges to Israel.</p>
<p>As a Jew myself, bearing an Israeli passport but living in the diaspora, I am faced with something of a dilemma. I do not see America as a particularly sure bet for my people. Shootings at synagogues and other centers of Jewish life are becoming more commonplace. Antisemitism is once again becoming ingrained into the political fabric. Presidential candidates sling pre-planned blame for their losses at the Jewish community. Minhag America, for the most part, is becoming more subdued, less safe, and much more protective of itself. Israel, in a similar fashion, is in dire straits. The economy is slowly drying up. Trauma among both Jews and Arabs is snowballing, as trauma tends to do. Again -- desperation is the mood of the hour. What little decorum existed in Israeli politics is trickling away. And the hostages are not yet home. Every chance denied, every deal torn up, either by Netanyahu or Sinwar, further abandons those in captivity. </p>
<p>But the end is not yet nigh. I don't mean to assert that the situation can't get worse -- as my dad likes to say, "the night is still young" -- but rather that despair is the wrong feeling. For too long, Israelis and Palestinians have relied on the same two sides of a losing coin, on despair and on blind faith. Neither side is rooted in reason. Neither side brings about a better future. Neither side can solve anything alone. The cycle must be broken, and both sides must find a new feeling: hope. </p>
<p>Unlike despair, and unlike blind faith, hope demands action. Hope is not a free ride, it is an opportunity. Hope the moral imperative to throw the weight from your shoulders before it is too late. To hope is not to feel assured. To hope is to feel your nerve wracking, but to embark on the difficult journey towards a better future anyways. In trying times like these, hope is as necessary to survival as food or water.</p>
<p>Less than a week ago, Jews worldwide marked the holiday of Rosh Hashanah -- the Jewish New Year. The year behind us had been marked by grief, despair, anxiety, and loss. The year in front of us -- 5875 -- was yet unstained by blood. As I heard the Shofar blow, I felt some of those same feelings, and I feel them now as I reflect. Now, however, I feel hope as well. I feel the imperative to reach towards an end to the bloodshed. If the people of the book were chosen to do anything, we are chosen to protect life, from one soul to the world's soul. I find that our action is as necessary here as in any other time of tests in our history. We must all wake up and find our way again. We must all take those difficult steps that mark the road to peace. If we will it, it shall be no dream. If we do not, if we choose that which is so clearly fleeting over that which is sacred, it shall be our fault alone when our grandchildren curse us as killers.</p>
