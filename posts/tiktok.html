    <h2>Even if it were American,</h2>
    <h1>TIKTOK SHOULD BE BANNED</h1>
    <p>I am writing this primarily as a response to <a href="https://nordicnews.net/14274/oped/editorial-tiktok-should-tick-on/">this article</a> published in my school's student newspaper. I will not go point-by-point per se, but I will try to address the article's major arguments and provide a few of my own.</p>
    <p>First, the obvious: TikTok is huge, addictive, and owned by a company based in China. Of course, some will debate the hand that the Chinese government, and thus the CCP, has in the operations of TikTok. Even though ByteDance (the aforementioned parent company) <a href = "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/07/tiktoks-china-bytedance-data-concerns">is required to comply with the Chinese government in matters of national security</a>, and even though TikTok <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/11/tiktok-china-us-elections-influence">has been used by a "[Chinese] propaganda arm" to influence the 2022 midterm elections </a>, I will grant those in favor of TikTok the benefit of the doubt on the question of CCP influence, and as such I will not discuss the topic further. See, even in a scenario where TikTok were owned by an American company, it would still pose a threat to the US's national security, thus earning its <a href = "https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/23/tech/congress-tiktok-ban-what-next/index.html"> 2024 ban</a> (ban-in-waiting, that is).</p>
    <p>My argument on this topic is that TikTok's content medium, short-form vertical videos, hurts critical thinking skills and decreases media literacy, creating an environment in which truth is not discernible to its inhabitants. Short-form content, especially in the way that it exists on TikTok, is a breeding ground of mis/dis-information. A common format on TikTok is the narration of a current events story, accompanied by a video of the narrator speaking, as well as an (optional) screenshot of a related news article. This presents a number of problems, even as differentiated from similar news-sharing behaviors on other social media platforms. First, unlike a link shared on Facebook, for example, it is often difficult to cite the claims being made in videos like those previously described, as those claims are being made verbally, and not necessarily with a direct source. Second, and perhaps more insidiously, short-form videos require little to no effort to make, share, and consume, processes that a platform like TikTok is incentivised to expedite. Along with being easy to produce, proliferate, and watch, videos on TikTok made with "talking head" narration, as described earlier are easy to trust, though this ease is unrelated to veracity of the claims made in said videos. There is clearly trust in the news conveyed via TikTok, as evidenced by <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/09/17/more-americans-regularly-get-news-on-tiktok-especially-young-adults/">Pew Research article</a> which states that "nearly 4 out of 10 adults in the U.S. now regularly get news on TikTok." If one were to present Captain Disinformation (the Russian cousin of Captain Obvious) with a platform built for the seamless production and consumption short-form content that is broadly trusted by its users, there would be enough foam at his mouth to diagnose him with rabies. On top of that, TikTok has not developed fact-checking features adapted to the unique contours of its platform. Twitter (a platform with similar challenges), did by contrast develop such a feature, known as "Community Notes", which remains one of the platform's bright spots. In totality, this presents a clear disregard for the preservation of factual information on the part of TikTok and its owners.</p>
<p>How, then, does such a disregard erode American national security? First, it should be established, in no uncertain terms, that America's primary national security interest is to protect, preserve, and defend her democracy. Some claim that it is, instead, to spread systems of democratic government around the globe, but this is only a result of the aforementioned primary interest, and it is only relevant when Americans think that their democracy can only be safe when the world is, in the words of the late President Woodrow Wilson, "safe for democracy". But how can a democracy exist when no one can tell truth from lies? How are voters supposed to make informed decisions when they have trouble discerning what's fact and what's fiction? How are politicians expected to make inroads with undecided or independently-minded voters when there is no longer a common reality from which to make arguments? How are we, as citizens, supposed to have dialogue with each other about important issues affecting us in the context of the aforementioned lack of a common reality? The answer to these question, and the myriad others that come up when a society is faced with the deterioration of truth, as we are now, is that there is no answer. TikTok, is, of course, not solely for said deterioration, but as the old saying goes, two wrongs do not make a right. We've already seen less nebulous examples of this. Take, for example, the infamous "Letter to America", published by Osama Bin Laden as a manifesto of sorts, explaining his motives for the 9/11 attacks. In November 2023, videos about the letter began widely circulating on TikTok, accruing <a href = "https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2023/11/16/guardian-osama-bin-laden-letter-to-america/">15 million views</a> by the time the hashtag often used by the videos (#lettertoamerica) was banned on TikTok (about three days after the trend began). The vast majority of these videos included no critical analysis, and in fact included little more than a call to action, wherein the viewers of said videos were directed towards reading the letter itself. This left out context, context which proves key to understanding the letter and its intention (most importantly, that the letter was a blatant piece of propaganda written by the leader of a terrorist group), prompting rightful concern commentators. Although TikTok was not the origin of last November's Bin Laden book club spree (traffic to the letter began where these things usually do, on Google), the platform did play a key role in widening the letter's reach. This presents a serious risk in that TikTok is an ideal platform for the spreading of context-less and misleading information which endangers both foreign and domestic confidence in American operations at a never-before-seen scale.</p>
<p>Before I close, I want to address a few things in the article (link) that I found particularly egregious. First, parts of the article's second paragraph appear to be a paraphrased version of a <a href = "https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-au/the-truth-about-tiktok">TikTok press release </a> made in April 2023. In particular, the phrase "founded by Chinese entrepreneurs in mainland China", in reference to Bytedance, is lifted directly from said press release. Though it is possible that this is a coincidence, I could not find any other articles that used the aforementioned phrase. Another issue present in the article is found in its fourth paragraph, which argues that the bill banning TikTok is flawed because it unfairly singles out TikTok. This is whataboutism, or an appeal to hypocrisy, not a valid argument. TikTok must be defensed on its merits, not on the demerits of other platforms. The article's last paragraph has two major issues, the first of which being that it refers to videos on TikTok which "helped bring millions of dollars in aid to the area [of the Texas Panhandle in which wildfires were occurring]." I could not find a single source which corroborated this claim, though I did find <a href = "https://www.mediamatters.org/tiktok/conspiracy-theories-about-record-breaking-texas-wildfire-spread-online-after-biden-visited">an article</a> which cites TikTok as a platform on which conspiracy theories about said wildfires were proliferated. The final paragraph of the article also makes a fairly bold claim that "very fact that TikTok is owned by a company with Chinese ties has put it under unfounded scrutiny, revealing the xenophobia behind the U.S. legislation. " Not only does said claim not address the legislation's merits, it fails to consider the fact that America does have legitimate cause for such scrutiny: namely, the fact that China is an authoritarian regime which has and continues to wage propaganda campaigns in the U.S., to the detriment of the U.S. TikTok, despite its attempts to assure customers of its independence, is very much subject to these propaganda campaigns. </p>
<p>In writing this post, I sought to debunk some of the assertions made in my school newspaper's article, and to present some of my own. Ultimately, to make a case against TikTok is to make a case against short-form content, which I feel I have done. The legislation banning TikTok is, of course, only the first step in what needs to be done to re-establish the primacy of truth in our common discourse. I would look forward to future governments setting clearer rules and standards for the social media giants which we filter so much of our communication and consumption through. </p>
