 <p>My name is Matthew (Borisovech[if we wanna be formal like that]) Epshtein. I am lead programmer(currently) for the <a href="https://frc3268.github.io/">Valhallabots.</a>
  <br>
  I like to call my self a programmer sometimes, and it may have come to my attention some time or another that I DO, in fact, have the right to do so.
  <a href="https://github.com/Chargde-Porcupine/">Here are</a> some of the programs that I WOULD say are evidence in favor of the above statements. 
  <br>
  That was WHO. WHY? I program because I ENJOY building cool things, and tbf(TO BE FRANK), thy shant look in to my reasonings further.
  <br>
  oh wait, I SKIPPED WHAT!or did I?
  <br>
  WHEN. Now/never/always/allatonce.
