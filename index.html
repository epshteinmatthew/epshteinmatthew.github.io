 <h2> A Couple Notes(On who I am, how I do things, and why I do things in the wway that I do things). </h2>
 <ul>
  <li>My name is Matthew Epshtein, and I live in Bothell, Washington(Think Microsoft Barracks but smaller). I'm a sophmore at Inglemoor High School in kenmore.</li>
  <li>I like to program computers. For me, not only is this a means to an end(I get to make cool stuff), but it allows me to engage in problem solving, something I value deeply.</li>
  <li>I dont think that programming langueges and a persons's choice in them matter that much, but I currently enjoy using ones like C, Golang, Javascript and Python to implement programs.</li>
  <li>I also program for my schools robotics team, <a href="https://www.frc3268.github.io">The ValhallaBots</a>. As lead programmer for said team, I am responsible for bringing to robot my classmates construct to life. I use Java to do this. On a sidenote, I also do wiring for the team occasionally.</li>
  <li>I use linux for daily use, due to my beleif that free software is morally and functionally better than non-free software.</li>
  <li>My politics are center-left to far-left, depending on who you as. I'd call myself a liberal.</li>
  <li>For fun and sanity, I like to play basketball and ride my bike. The latter is more of a transportation method, but I still enjoy riding.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h2>Here is a list of some projects I've created or helped create. </h2>

  <li>ValhallaErrors: A fullstack web app built to track errors for the ValhallaBots, hence the name. [Data Structures, SQL, Golang, Svelte, Web Development, Algorithtims]</li>
