<h2>profile:</h2>
<p>
    I am an 11th grader, hailing proudly from <a href="https://www.inglemoor.nsd.org">Inglemoor High School</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenmore%2C_Washington">Kenmore, Washington</a>.<br>
    I have strong experience in several areas of programming, including frontend and backend web development, Computer Vision with <a href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a>, and robotics programming with Java and Kotlin.<br>
    I continously put effort into improving my skills in these areas and others, on my own in concert with my peers.<br>
    I participate actively in the robotics club at my school, <a href="http://valhallabots.tech">the valhallabots</a>, sticking on through the highs and lows.<br>
    I do, in fact, have human emotions, despite what the previous four sentences would suggest.
