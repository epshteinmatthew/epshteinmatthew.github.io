        <p>
            Hello! I'm Matthew Epshtein, a junior at Inglemoor High School in Kenmore, Washington, and an IB Diploma Candidate, graduating in June 2025. I like to <a href = "https://frc3268.github.io">have fun and build robots</a> as part of my school's robotics team, for which I am the President and Programing Lead. I also play basketball sometimes.
        </p>
